##  MVP - Sprint 1

###  Description

Our first MVP for sprint 1 will ensure that our customer/client will have a functional vitual wardrobe that allows for clothing storage. Users will be able to upload a clothing item and input specific information such as name, brand, etc to be stored in a database. In our case, we decided for a NoSQL database using MongoDB, connected by node/express and mongoose. Users will also be able to use the camera, but full upload via camera may be completed in the next sprint. 

###  Value Proposition
How does this MVP add value to the user, how is it better than their current alternatives.
When comparing to google's version of clothing fit check, Doppl, we noticed that you were forced to upload the entire outfit at once in a top/down picture format.  
This means that their algorithm is only able to detect clothes if you submit a picture of:
- An full body image of someone wearing an outfit and Doppl will recognize the clothes they are wearing and equip it onto your model.
- An image where the tops (shirt/jacket/etc) is directly above the bottoms (pants/shorts/etc) 

Doppl lacks a wardrobe feature since they only have suggested outfits that are pre-registered and only WHOLE outfit uploads, so mixing and matching different tops/bottoms are difficult.
